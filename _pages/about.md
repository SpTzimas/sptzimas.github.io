I am a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Mathematics of the University of Ioannina, Greece,
studying the computational/parameterized complexity of separation problems in graph theory.
I am interested in all things:
* Foundations of Mathematics
* Theoretical Computer Science
* Artificial Intelligence
* Big Data / Data Science
